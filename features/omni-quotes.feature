Feature: Display Random quote
  In order to be inspired
  As a iddle emacs user
  I want to do have quotes display

  Scenario: Turn on quotes mode
     When I call "omni-quotes-mode"
     Then I should see message "Omni-Quotes mode enabled"

  Scenario: Ask for quotes
  # Â§TODO
    Given I have "something"
    When I have "something"
    Then I should have "something"
    And I should have "something"
    But I should not have "something"
